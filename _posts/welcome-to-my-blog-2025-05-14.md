Hi everyone! I’m Meng Yuan, and I’ve spent the last few years buried in evaluation scripts, embedding visualizations, and late-night experiments on bootstrapping IR metrics. After finishing my PhD at the University of Melbourne and now working as a Research Fellow, I realized there’s a lot I want to share beyond dry papers and conference slides—so I finally decided to start this blog.

Here you’ll find:

- **IR Evaluation stories**:
  How I debugged those pesky statistical anomalies last winter, and why bootstrap sampling can save you from very misleading p-values.

- **Embedding Interpretability tips**:
  Practical snippets for visualizing topic clusters, plus little tricks I’ve picked up to make embeddings “tell a story.”

- **Search-as-Learning explorations**:
  I’ve been fascinated by how people actually learn when they search—think of your Google queries as mini-lessons. I’ll share some early prototypes and my (often messy) notes.

- **RAG & LLM Reasoning experiments**:
  My current obsession is combining retrieval-augmented generation with LLM “chain-of-thought” to build more transparent search helpers. No formal publications yet, but I’ll post code examples and my raw results here.

A few side notes, because life isn’t only code:

> Last weekend I dragged my quiet cat, Cabbage, to his second vet check (poor guy), and that gave me time to sketch out this site on the train. Expect some “behind the scenes” stories—like how I balance writing these posts with my daily cardio boxing sessions (my heart rate hates me, but I love the sweat).

I hope this becomes a place where both IR newcomers and fellow researchers can find something useful—and maybe a little entertaining too. Feel free to leave comments, suggest topics, or just say hi!

— Meng
